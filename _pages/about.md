README
======

I am an assistant professor at School of Cyber Science and Technology, Shandong University. I work broadly on high performance computing related research. 

Before that, I obtained my Ph.D. from The University of Hong Kong under the supervision of Prof. Cho-Li Wang in 2022 and received my B.S. degree in Computer Science from University of Hong Kong in 2018.
